# This is an example yaretrc file.  Please use 'yaret --help' for more options
# and information about those options.
#
# This file has been set to the same defaults builtin to the yaret program
# itself.  Please copy this file to ~/.yaretrc so that yaret will
# automatically read from it.
#
# Additionally, select one ripper, one normalizer and at least one encoder,
# before you try to use yaret (below).
#
# Also, you may want to check the output patterns, and change them to suit
# your preferences.
#
# If you change them, realize that you cannot use multiple encoders
# concurrently (at the same time), if both encoders use the same extension and
# none of the output patterns include the ENCODER keyword.
# (In otherwords, each encoder must create a unique filename).

name "TRACK_NUM - TRACK"
# This setting affects the formatting of the TRACK_NUM keyword.
# it is in the same format as printf and will be fed an integer (the current
# track number).  You may use the letter 'X' to mean the length of the largest
# track.  (i.e. "%Xd" would become "%3d" if there were between 100-999 tracks,
# and would be "%2d" if there were 10-99, etc.)
track_num_format "%02d"
# This setting affects filenames generated:
#trans "NOOP"
#trans "tr/ /_/"
# get rid of the + and every invalid character will map to an '_', otherwise
# it will take several invalids and map to just one '_'.  e.g. "The Best! Music"
# turns into "The_Best__Music" or "The_Best_Music" respectively.

# Oh, and change your [root] settings too!

# The include option allows you to include other configuration files

# settings for a CD).
# Example:
#  include test

# Translated KEYWORDS:
# YaRET supports several keywords that are translated.
# Some are not available at all times (for instance FILE_IN and FILE_OUT are not
# available when setting what the output name should be!)
# 		Availability
# Name:		[cddb]	[output]	[ripper]	[normalize]	[encoder]

# ARTIST	Yes	Yes		No		No		Yes*

# Some notes about these KEYWORDS:
# ENCODER is the label specified in the [encoder] section
# FILE_IN is the input file given to the program to read
# FILE_LIST is the list of files to be modified
# FILE_OUT is the output file given the the program to write
# In the [cddb] section, you are setting the values, not reading from them
# In the section [output] you may prepend any valid [cddb] tag with the
# word "MAIN_".  This has the effect of choosing the album's main tag, instead
# of the track specific one.  Primarily useful for artist name.
# e.g. it would choose "Various Artists" over track 1's "Ace of Base".

# * NOTE:  These should be used for setting tagging information (e.g. ID3 tags)
#          -not- for setting the output file name -- please use FILE_OUT for
#          that.

# Here you can override the information gathered via the cddb process (note
# that the cddb library uses the ~/.cdserverrc file and ~/.cddb directory for
# various configuration [and so we don't try to configure those things here])
# This section is mainly useful by creating a separate file and including it
# as configuration data via the --include command line option.
# The only option you may want to set is the cddb_out option (which is a file
# that is output at the end of the process that details the contents of the
# cd).
